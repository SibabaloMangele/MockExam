    steps:
      # Step 1: Checkout code from the repository
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Set up .NET SDK (version 8.0)
      - name: Setup .NET
        uses: actions/setup-dotnet@v4
        with:
          dotnet-version: 8.0.x

      # Step 3: Restore dependencies
      - name: Restore dependencies
        run: dotnet restore

      # Step 4: Build the application (no restore, as restore was already done)
      - name: Build the application
        run: dotnet build --configuration Release --no-restore

      # Step 5: Run tests
      - name: Run tests
        run: dotnet test --configuration Release --no-build --verbosity normal

      # Step 6: Deploy the application (you can modify this for your deployment method)
      - name: Deploy to Azure (or another deployment platform)
        if: success()  # Only run deployment if previous steps succeed
        run: |
          echo "Deploying the application..."
          # Replace with your actual deployment command or action
          # Example for Azure deployment:
          # az webapp deploy --name <app-name> --resource-group <resource-group> --src-path ./bin/Release/net8.0/publish
          
          # For example, deployment via Azure CLI (make sure you have AZ CLI configured in GitHub Secrets)
          # az webapp deploy --resource-group ${{ secrets.AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP }} --name ${{ secrets.AZURE_WEBAPP_NAME }} --src-path ./bin/Release/net8.0/publish
